# Loops, conditions and parsing

In this project, I learn how to write shell bash scripts.I also learn how to create SSH Keys and how to use loops.

## Project Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env` bash over `#!/bin/bash`
* How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
* How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements
* How to use the `cut` command
